    <!-- Blog 1: Speed -->
    <section id="speed" class="blog-article">
      <h1 class="blog-title">Why Speed Matters in Web Development</h1>
      <p class="blog-meta">Posted by W.P Team | April 2025</p>
      <article>
        <p>Speed is no longer optional. Users expect websites to load instantly. When a site lags even by a second, conversion rates drop, bounce rates increase, and brand trust suffers.</p>
        <p>We design our websites with performance in mind from the first line of code. Optimization isn't a final step — it's baked into every decision we make along the way.</p>
        <p>Fast sites respect the user's time. They show that you care about the experience, not just the look. And in an age where competition is a click away, speed builds loyalty you cannot buy.</p>

    <!-- Blog 2: Accessibility -->
    <section id="accessibility" class="blog-article">
      <h1 class="blog-title">Building Accessible Websites</h1>
      <p class="blog-meta">Posted by W.P Team | April 2025</p>
      <article>
        <p>Accessibility is not a bonus feature. It’s a requirement if you want your website to reach everyone, regardless of ability or device.</p>
        <p>We focus on clean semantic HTML, proper use of alt texts, high contrast design, and full keyboard navigation to make sure our projects are accessible from the start.</p>
        <p>Building for accessibility shows respect for your users — and in many cases, it's also a legal obligation depending on the region.</p>

    <!-- Blog 3: UX -->
    <section id="ux" class="blog-article">
      <h1 class="blog-title">Minimal Design = Better UX?</h1>
      <p class="blog-meta">Posted by W.P Team | April 2025</p>
      <article>
        <p>Minimal design is not about empty spaces. It's about focusing on the essentials and removing anything that gets in the way of user goals.</p>
        <p>We prefer clean layouts, logical navigation, and readable content because real-world users don’t have time to guess what to do next.</p>
        <p>Minimalism in UX is about respecting the user's time, attention, and mental load.</p>
